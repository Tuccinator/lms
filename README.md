# Learning Module Standard and Format

A simple standard and format for course developers and course consumers to integrate courses into any platform.

### Inspiration

The internet is swarming with useful information, but not a very useful method of displaying all of that information. Sure, you can follow some of your favourite course creators, enthusiasts, developers, but it's hard to keep track and actually follow along with their progress. I'm setting out to build the RSS of learning; the ability to answer questions, follow courses, create projects, etc. The LMS will allow any person to subscribe to their favourite people, and not just receive articles, but all of the material needed to stay involved.

### Features
- [ ] URLs to retrieve the materials

	- Equations
	- Graphs
	- Drag and Drop

### Implementation
All providers and consumers must implement the format using JSON.
